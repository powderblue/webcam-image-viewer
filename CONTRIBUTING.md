After making changes to the code, *you must run the build script*:

```sh
npm run build
```

This command also checks the JavaScript using [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/), so don't be surprised if the build fails; if it does, deal with any issues and then try again.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Commit only after running the build-script and only if the build was successful
